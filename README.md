# PODFilter
Repo for testing program for developping POD software

This repository only contains a small Qt program that loads the content of a CSV file outputed by the program on the "SDL" branch of the https://github.com/Ybalrid/PSTOmni repository.

This is a tool to help develop the signal processing code that will run on the raspberry pi embeded inside POD
